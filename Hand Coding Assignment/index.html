            <h1>About Plein Air</h1>
                <p> If you are new to plein air painting, you may have <strong>a lot</strong> of questions. Let’s start with the basics.
                <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_plein_air" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> What is plein air painting?</a> En plein air is French for “the open air” or “outdoors.” So as the name implies, plein air painting is taking your painting gear and painting outdoors. As you may have guessed by the name, it is attributed to a French painter named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Henri_de_Valenciennes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes</a>  (1750-1819). While it was not a new practice then, it was made more feasible with the invention of tubed paint and portable box easels. Today, the gear has evolved to make plein air painting accessible to painters of all skill levels, mediums, and budgets.
                <p>Some of the other questions you may have could be:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>What equipment do I need?</li>
                    <li>How do I get started?</li>
                    </ul>
                <p> For more information on those questions, check out the equipment and guides pages. This site also has information on plein air events and a discussion board for fellow painters to ask and answer questions.

                    <h3>Get your equipment ready:</h3>
                    <p>The first step is to gather the equipment you'll need to pain on site and away from your studio.</p>
            
                    <h3>Do a test run:</h3>
                    <p>You will want to do your first attempt nearby. Good locations are in your driveway or other close location. Pack your gear and pretend you are not at home. Then pay attention to what you use and what you don't. Keep a list of things you left behind that you needed so you can bring them on your next test run.</p>
           
                    <h3>Scope out locations:</h3>
                    <p>Don't just hop in the car and drive to your favorite hiking trail to paint. Go to your local hiking trail and hike until you find a spot you think you would like to paint at. Make a note of how far it is from the trailhead. How long did it take you to hike to the spot? Take pictures of the view to prepare sketches beforehand. Where is the nearest restroom? Do you have cellphone service? Make a note of anything you might need when you pack your gear. For this second location, it is still wise to stick close to home.</p>
            
                    <h3>Do a test run at prepared site:</h3>
                    <p>After your reconnaissance mission, it's time for you to do a test run at the site you prepared for. Take notes, and don't be too proud to leave if things start to go south. What feels like a gentle breeze when hiking can knock over your easel when you're actually trying to paint.</p>
            
                    <h3>Learn what works for you and what doesn't:</h3>
                    <p>One painter's list of gear can differ widely from another's. Experienced painters may only need to bring primary colors for their paints. Beginners may find that a few pre-mixed colors added to the mix saves them a lot of time. Keep going on short trips until you have a better feel of what works for your style and personal preferences.</p>
            
                    <h3>Have fun!</h3>
                    <p>This one should be self-explanatory. If it's not fun, why are you doing it?</p>

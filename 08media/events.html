            <h1>Events</h1> 
            <h2 id=#sign>Where can I participate in events?</h2>
            <p>There are four main types of events you can participate in as a plein air painter.
                <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Competitions -<br>
                    Painters gather to compete for prize money against other painters. There are usually entrance fees to submit work, but there is also often an opportunity for networking or selling your pieces.</li>
                    <li>Demonstrations -<br>
                    An experienced painter will demonstrate techniques for an audience. Most times these have an entrance fee. Sometimes the demonstration could be organized by a local art association or church who will pay the demonstrator's fee for attendees.</li>
                    <li>Workshops -<br>
                    An experienced painter will demonstrate techniques for an audience, but these differ from demonstrations. The audience participates by painting with the demonstrator and often receive personalized feedback. In addition to an entrance fee there is usually a supply list or supply fee for participants.</li>
                    <li>Meet-ups -<br>
                    Local painters gather in a single location to paint in a group. There is no competition involved necessarily, and the main aim is socialization and networking. These events are usually free but the artists bring their own supplies.</li>
                </ol>
                
            <h3>Ways to participate in competition events:</h3> 
                    <ul>
                    <li>Search for local competitions near you. Join local art associations and follow local artists on social media to stay up to date on upcoming events.</li>
                    <li>Plan a trip and travel to a distant event.</li>
                    <li>Submit a finished piece to an online competition. Follow art-centered businesses or artists on social media. Some companies will sponsor events as a marketing strategy.</li>
                    </ul>
                        
            <h3>Ways to participate in demonstrations:</h3>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Join local art associations and follow local artists on social media to stay up to date on upcoming events.</li>
                    <li>Subscribe to a plein air painter's YouTube channel and watch their videos. A lot of artists will have free videos and more detailed demonstrations available for purchase through Patreon or personal websites.</li>
                    <li>Check local listings for businesses. You would be surprised what companies may sponsor an event to bring in customers.</li>
                    </ul>
            
            <h3>Ways to participate in workshops</h3>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Join local art associations and follow local artists on social media to stay up to date on upcoming events. I know. This is getting redundant, but these are the best ways to keep informed.</li>
                    <li>Enroll in a community education class through a local community college. No college enrollment needed. Local community colleges and universities often offer classes that are a great resource for beginners to learn in a more academic setting.</li>
                    <li>Subscribe to an online workshop. Artists are no longer restricted to in person learning, and professional artists use this as a business opportunity for online classes.</li>
                    </ul>
            <h3>Ways to participate in meet-ups</h3>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Join local art associations. If you haven't already learned these groups are a great resource, here's one more reminder. Associations usually have recurring meetings in person or online, and joining them is a way to meet other artists in your area.</li>
                    <li>Join Facebook groups dedicated to plein air painting.</li></ul>

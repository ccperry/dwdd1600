            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                We believe in value and our name says it all - we sell vacations on a budget. With <span class="company">Budget Vacations</span>, you travel <b>more</b>, spend <i>less</i>.</p>
            <p>
                Our company was founded by Sarah Smith when her retired parents expressed a desire to travel more on a fixed income, but they werenâ€™t sure how to find the best deals. There were so many discount websites that her parents were overwhelmed. As part of the travel industry, Sarah knew how to navigate the confusing world of airfare, hotels, and cruises, and she had established relationships with the companies to gain access to their best discounted prices. Sarah put her skills to use and began to create budget vacations for her parents, and the word soon got out to friends and family. To help more retirees with their travel needs, Sarah founded Budget Vacations. </p>
            <p>
                <span class="company">Budget Vacations</span> makes travel simpler and more affordable. We take care of everything, so you can relax and know you are getting the best prices. While the company started with retirees in mind, our vacation packages cater to travelers of all ages on a budget. </p>

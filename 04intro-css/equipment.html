            <h1>Equipment</h1>
            <p> <h2 id="sign"> What equipment do I need?</h2>
            <p>Technically, you only need:
                <ul>
                <li>Painting surface
                <li>Easel</li>
                <li>Paint brushes</li>
                <li>Paints</li>
                </ul>
                    
            <h3>Painting surface</h3> 
                <p>These are most often:
                    <dl>
                            <dt>Canvas</dt>
                            <dd>Linen stretched over a wooden frame.</dd>
                            <dt>Gessoboard</dt>
                            <dd>Thin cut of wood primed with acrylic gesso.</dd>
                    </dl>
            <h3>Easel</h3> 
                <p>These come in different forms:
                    <dl>
                            <dt>Easel</dt>
                            <dd>Adjustable wooden frame to hold the painting surface. Can be self-supporting or require a tripod.</dd>
                            <dt>Pouchade box</dt>
                            <dd>Portable briefcase-like box that can hold a painting surface. Usually requires a tripod for support.</dd>
                    </dl>
                            
            <p>While these items are all you technically <em>need</em>, there are a lot of items that make plein air painting much easier for painters new to the hobby. The gear depends on your medium, but most painters prefer oil paint due to its longer drying time. This is very helpful if you are out on a hot day where acrylics, gouache, and watercolor paints would dry in less than a minute. Since that is what I use, I will list the gear accordingly. However, you can adjust the list according to your <em>preferred</em> medium. For example, if you prefer watercolor, you will need more water and won't need mineral spirits.</p>
                       
            <p>Here are the basics:</p>
            
                <h3>Painting gear</h3>
                    <h4>Essential:</h4>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Easel - These can range in cost and weight. Depending on the model, you may need a tripod to hold the easel up.</li>
                    <li>Painting surface - Canvas, gesso boards, or whatever your preferred painting surface is in a size that can be picked up and moved from one location to another.</li>
                    <li>Carrying case for wet artwork - You will need something to protect your work-in-progress in transit. You don’t want to be walking around with a wet canvas and trip! Some easels come with compartments for wet artworks, and those are great if you are trying to carry less.
                    <li>Brushes and brush holder - Remember that you have to carry these to your location. You don’t want your entire studio’s worth of brushes. Bring your most essential/favorite brushes in a protective holder.</li>
                    <li>Paint - Only the essential colors are recommended. Some oil painters premix a few colors before heading to the location, but you can mix on sight.
                    <li>Mixing surface and tools - A palette and palette knife are staples. Some easels come with places to store mixed paint (and wet canvases, as mentioned above). If yours doesn't, a <a href="https://a.co/d/8KShqpd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Masterson palette</a> or something similar is very helpful to keep the wet paint contained and fresh. </li>
                    <li>Brush cleaner in leakproof container - For oil painters, this would be odorless mineral spirits, like Turpenoid. While you can use any leak-proof container, the <a href="https://a.co/d/01ORig2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stainless steel hanging</a> ones are the most common. It is not recommended to bring glass containers of any kind due to the danger of breaking and possible injury.</li>
                    <li>Backpack - You will need a comfortable backpack to carry all your gear.</li>
                    <li>Paper towels/rags - I prefer <a href="https://a.co/d/fdgzq7a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shop towels</a> for painting in and outdoors, but old towels or dishcloths would work if you prefer those.</li>
                    <li>Trash bag - I'm no boy scout, but if you love the outdoors enough to paint it, you should love it enough to leave no trace. Pack it in. Pack it out.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Optional:</h4>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Viewfinder - It does not weigh much or take up much space. It can help with composition by cropping your line of sight.</li>
                        <li>Value finder - Value, value, value. Even artists with years of experience use value finders.</li>
                        <li>Sketchbook and pencil - When you don't have time to revise your underpainting, quick sketches to plan a composition are very helpful. You could also plan your painting beforehand by going to the location with a sketchbook and composing several thumbnails.</li>
                        <li>Camera - For most people, this will be their phone. Even though the goal is to paint on site, you will want reference photos, especially if you need to make a hasty exit and want to finish later.</li>
                        </ul>
                <h3>Personal gear</h3>
                    <h4>Essential:</h4>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Water - It's never good to go far without water, but if it is a warm, summer day, be sure to bring extra.</li>
                    <li>Sunscreen - Spending hours in the sun makes this a necessity.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Optional:</h4>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Wide-brimmed hat - This helps keep the sun out of your eyes versus sunglasses, which can skew the tint of the colors you are trying to match.</li>
                    <li>Bug repellant - For most, this is optional. For me, it's a necessity. Mosquitos love me, and the feeling is not mutual.</li>
                    <li>Umbrella - According to Murphy's Law, if you don't bring it, it will rain.</li>
                    <li>Snacks - You don't want to cut your painting session short because you're hangry.</li>
                    <li>Weather wear - Just like any outdoor excursion, plan for the worst and hope for the best.</li>
                    </ul>
